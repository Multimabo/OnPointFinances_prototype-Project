<!-- This is a placeholder for the PNG logo -->
<!-- In a real implementation, you would use an image editing tool to create a PNG version -->
<!-- The SVG version above will work perfectly for modern browsers -->

<!-- If you need a PNG version, you can:
1. Open the SVG file in a web browser
2. Take a screenshot or use "Save as PNG" if available
3. Or use an online SVG to PNG converter
4. Or use image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or Canva -->

<!-- For now, the SVG logo will work perfectly in all modern browsers -->
